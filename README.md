#Yeezy-Raffle-Scripts
A collection of python scripts to increase your chances at winning a yeezy raffle online. All must be run using python3. 

BEFORE RUNNING ANY OF THESE:
pip install requests
pip install j2py

YME UNIVERSE: if the raffle entry is successful you will get one email per entry. Be prepared for a flooded inbox. 

Boutique1: Servers a little slow, might take a little longer. No email for an entry.

SlamJamSocialism Arcadism: Go to http://www.slamjamsocialism.com/arcad-ism/ and create a new account to play with. Then go to this script and change the email variable and score variable to what you desire. This will bypass the dinosaur game all together and post the high score directly to their servers.
